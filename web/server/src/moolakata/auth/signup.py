"""Sign-up (requirements S10.1.4): when an admin turns it on, a person asks for an account
with their name, email, a username and a password; confirms the email from a link; and waits
until an admin approves or rejects the request. Approval makes the user.

Whether an email address already has an account is never revealed: the answer to a request
is the same either way, and only a new address gets a link.
